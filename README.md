## Crop recommendation app



Crop prediction and analysis is an ML application which receive questions from the clients, tries to understand the question and provide appropriate data output for the user which is the best suitable crop for particular season.


## Number of various crops:  50


List of Crops:  'PADDY' 'Wheat' 'JOWAR ' 'BAJRA ' 'MAIZE' 'RAGI   ' 'REDGRAM'
 'GREENGRAM  ' 'BLACKGRAM ' 'HORSEGRAM' 'BengalGram' 'Cowpea' 'GROUNDNUT'
 'SESAMUM (Gingelly)' 'SUNFLOWER' 'Safflower' 'CASTOR  ' 'SOYABEAN'
 'COTTON' 'Chillies' 'SUGARCANE  ' 'ONION' 'Tomato' 'Brinjal' 'Ginger'

 'Cashew ' 'Mulberry' 'Coconut' 'Jasmine' 'Chrysanthemum' 'Avacado'.

## Factors on which data has been collected: 


Temperature detail, Soil type,
Type of Crop, Rainfall, Humidity, Wind speed and Duration of the crop

## Conclusion

Our farmers are not effectively using technology and analysis, so they may not choose the appropriate crop for the cultivation. Hence loss is expected. Farmers need to be well educated about this technology, so that they can have a clear understanding about the best crop and its suitable features. To deal with this, our web based app  is developed using a Logistic regression algorithm. This model gave the best results and can help the farmers to make smart decisions on the farming. This approach specifies the ideal conditions that are to be maintained to get maximum profit.  It also helps in finding the best combination of crops for mixed cropping. This model helps the farmer to sow the crops which can be profitable, even if he has minimum knowledge on the features like soil pH, NPK values, weather parameters etc. If the rancher is at home, the work can be managed at that particular instant of time, without facing any kind of loss going forward. From this we can conclude that this model is beneficial for growing farmers economically.
